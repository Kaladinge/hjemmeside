    <p class="overskrift">Favorittsitat:</p>
      <p class="sitat">"If you find your truth you must follow it.
      You could find it in a paper bag,
      or in a statue, or in a slaughterhouse;
       you might find it dangling somewhere.
      People might say: "What the heck are you doing?",
      but it's OK if they don't understand. And if your
      follow it, stay true to it, and respect it, you
      could be in store for the greatest journey you
      could ever imagine".</p>
